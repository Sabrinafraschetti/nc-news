NC-News is a dynamic news platform built with React, providing users with a seamless, interactive experience. The app pulls data from a backend API, allowing users to explore articles, vote, and engage through comments. Designed to be user-friendly, responsive, and accessible, NC-News fosters a highly interactive environment.

Users can browse a list of articles on the homepage, easily sortable by criteria such as date, author, or topic. From there, they can dive into individual articles, read related comments, and cast votes to express their opinions. A login feature enables users to post and delete comments, enhancing engagement and fostering user interaction.
